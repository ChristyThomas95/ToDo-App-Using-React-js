# Todo App using React
This is a simple Todo App I created in my learning time to improve my skill in react. The users can add their daily tasks to the app by inputting the task and clicking add button. At the same time, they can remove the task once it is completed by pressing the delete button. For fun, I have added an alert feature and pending task reminder in the app's title.
